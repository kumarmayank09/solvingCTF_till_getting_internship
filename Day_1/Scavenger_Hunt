🚩 Conquering the Scavenger Hunt CTF on picoCTF!
CTF challenges (Capture The Flag) are an incredible way to enhance your cybersecurity skills while having fun. Recently, I tackled a challenge called "Scavenger Hunt" on picoCTF, where I explored various web files to uncover hidden flags. Here’s a breakdown of the experience and insights into the files involved – perfect for anyone looking to dive into ethical hacking!

🌐 Key Files Explored
HTML Files: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of any webpage. By viewing the source code (Ctrl+U in most browsers), I uncovered comments and metadata that led to potential clues. Always inspect the <head> and hidden <div> tags for breadcrumbs.
 🔍 Lesson: Never underestimate the power of "View Page Source" in web recon!

CSS Files: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) defines a webpage’s style. In this challenge, the CSS files had unusual class names and hidden text. Digging deeper into the styling rules sometimes revealed encoded or concealed messages.
 🔍 Lesson: Scrutinize unconventional class names or off-screen text styles.

JavaScript Files: JavaScript often contains client-side logic. In one instance, a JS file held an obfuscated function, which, when decoded, led me to a flag. Tools like browser developer tools or online JavaScript beautifiers can help you make sense of such files.
 🔍 Lesson: Always check JavaScript for hidden logic or endpoints.

robots.txt: Designed to guide search engine crawlers, this file is a goldmine for restricted directories. In the challenge, accessing paths disallowed by robots.txt revealed hidden files and directories containing flags.
 🔍 Lesson: If it’s in robots.txt, it’s worth investigating.

.htaccess: This configuration file manages server behavior. While not accessible directly on most live servers, the challenge simulated misconfigurations that exposed directories and sensitive files.
 🔍 Lesson: Understand how server misconfigurations can expose vulnerabilities.

.DS_Store: This macOS metadata file can reveal directory structures and even file paths. By downloading and analyzing .DS_Store files, I reconstructed hidden directory layouts to find flags.
 🔍 Lesson: Even innocuous-seeming files can provide critical intelligence.

💡 Pro Tips for CTF Challenges
Start Simple: Always explore the obvious first – View Source, directory structures, and visible files.
Use the Right Tools: Familiarize yourself with tools like curl, wget, Burp Suite, and browser developer tools.
Stay Curious: Hidden flags require persistence and creative thinking.

🌟 Takeaways
Participating in challenges like these reinforces the importance of secure coding practices and proper server configurations. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned pro, CTFs are a fun way to sharpen your skills.
